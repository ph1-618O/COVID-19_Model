                                                    analyze the impact covid has had on each individual state. By

                                                    June, early July, we reach an inflection point. Here we see a much
                                                    lower fatality rate of 1.4%. Finally, the third and largest surge in
                                                    cases of Covid-19 in America, we see a steady drop in the fatality
                                                    rate to 0.8%. Though it is important to note that at the time this
